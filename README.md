### What I learned

Writing effect for strings.

```python
def writing_effect(txt, time = 0.05):
    for char in txt:
        sleep(time)
        print(char, end="")
        sys.stdout.flush()
```

Elevating block effect for strings.

```python
def rise_effect(txt, time):
    lines_txt = txt.split("\n")
    for line in lines_txt:
        print(line)
        sleep(time)
```
